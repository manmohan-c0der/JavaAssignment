If we don’t assign values to array elements and try to access them, the compiler does not produce an error as in the case of simple variables. Instead, it assigns values that aren’t garbage. 
1	boolean	false
2	int	0
3	double	0.0
4	String	null
5	User-Defined Type	null

Ans 2
No, you cannot use a negative integer as size, the size of an array represents the number of elements in it, –ve number of elements in an array makes no sense.

The reference types in Java are stored in heap area. Since arrays are reference types (we can create them using the new keyword) these are also stored in heap area.

Ans 4
once we create the size cannot be increased/decreased.

It stores only homogeneous data elements.

Ans 4
An array without a name is called Anonymous Array.

This type of array is created just for instance use.

Example :
class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
          // anonymous array
          sum(new int[]{ 1, 2, 3 });
    }
   
    public static void sum(int[] a)
    {
        int total = 0;
 
        // using for-each loop
        for (int i : a)
            total = total + i;
         
        System.out.println("The sum is: " + total);
    }
}

You can traverse through an array using for loop or forEach loop. Using the for loop − Instead on printing element by element, you can iterate the index using for loop starting from 0 to length of the array (ArrayName. length) and access elements at each index

Ans 6
length: It is a property of the Array type class.

length(): It is a method of String class.
